Suppose that the sequence P R I O * R * * I * T * Y * * * Q U E * * * U * E (where a letter means insert and an asterisk means remove the maximum) is applied to an initially empty priority queue. Give the sequence of values returned by remove the maximum operations.

Step -1 :

  p

take p as parent.

step-2:

  p          R
 /   =>     /
R          P

assign R as child. and exchange because R is greater than P.

step-3::

   R
  / \
 P   I

assign I as child.

step-4::

     R
    / \
   P   I
  /
 O

assign O as child of P.

Step-5::
since the next element is * remove the max element then the new tree is

    P
   / \
  O   I

step-6::

     P                R
    / \              / \
   O   I    ==>     P   I
  /                /
 R                O

assign R as child of O and exchange the max in order.

Step-7::

since the next element is * remove the max element then the new tree is

   O                P
  / \      ==>     / \
 P   I            O   I

Step-8::

since the next element is * remove the max element then the new tree is

  I             O
 /       ==>   /
O             I

Step-9::
assign I as child of O.

   O
  / \
 I   I

Step-10::
since the next element is * remove the max element then the new tree is

   I
  /
 I

Step-11::
assign T as I's child and exchange the max in order.

  I            T
 / \    ==>   / \
I   T        I   I

Step-12::
since the next element is * remove the max element then the new tree is
  I
 /
I
Step-13::
assign Y as I's child and exchange the max in order.

   I            Y
  / \     ==>  / \ 
 I   Y        I   I

Step-14::
since the next 3 elements are * remove all the elements in the tree then the tree will be empty

Step-15::
assign Q as parent and U as child and exchange the max in order.

   Q               U
  /        ==>    /
 U               Q

Step-16::
assign E as U's child

   U
  / \
 Q   E

step-17::
since the next 3 elements are * remove all the elements in the tree then the tree will be empty

Step-18::
assign U as parent in the tree.

    U

Step-19::
since the next element is * remove the max element then the tree will be empty

Step-20::
assign E as parent as it is the last element to be inserted into the tree.

  E

Question::Is an array that is sorted in Ascending order a min-oriented heap? Why?

Answer:: YES

For a min heap, we must have parents[i] <= child[i]. For an array is sorted order, the children of any node at index k, if they exist, are at 2*k and/or 2*k + 1. Since the array is in sorted order and they are at a greater index, noth children are greater than or equal to the parent, satisfying the min heap property.

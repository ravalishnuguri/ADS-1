Give the sequences of nodes examined when the methods in BST are used to compute each of the following quantities for the tree drawn at below.
a. floor("Q") 
b. select(5) 
c. ceiling("Q") 
d. rank("J") 
e. size("D", "T") 
f. keys("D", "T")

the tree is  :::
                        E
                       / \
                      D   Q
                     /   / \
                    A   J    T
                        \    /
                         M  S


a. the floor is Q
b. select of 5 gives the output as M
c. ceil is also Q
d. the rank of J is 3
e. size of D and T is 4
f. the keys of D and T are D, E, J, Q, S, T.

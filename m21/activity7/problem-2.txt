Draw the red-black BST that results when you insert letters A to K in order into an initially empty red-black BST. Then, describe what happens in general when red-black BSTs are built by inserting keys in ascending order.

the resultant red-black BST that we ge after inserting A B C D E F G H I J K is ::

                    

                   H
               r/    \
               D       J
              / \     / \
             B   F   I  K
            / \  / \
           A  C  E  G

any tree that is inserted in ascending order is perfectly balanced and also if the number of insertions is equal to a power of 2 its also be a completly balanced tree.but our tree does have 11 insertions and it does not equal to power of 2.so, it is not completly balanced.

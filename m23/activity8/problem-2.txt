Suppose that the keys A through G , with the hash values given below, are inserted in some order into an initially empty table of size 7 using a linear-probing table (with no resizing for this problem). Which of the following could not possibly result from inserting these keys?

                    KEYS::   A  B  C  D  E  F  G
                    hASH::   2  0  0  4  4  4  1

ANS)
               index ==  0  1  2  3  4  5  6
                keys ==  B  C  A  G  D  E  F

these are the positions of the keys after inserting it into the table.in the given options none of the options will result in this order after inserting the keys.SO the answer is all of the option are not possible result from inserting these keys.
